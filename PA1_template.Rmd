## Loading and preprocessing the data
* Unzip the file to get the uncompressed activity.csv file.
* Then load this .csv file.

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
data<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
* Do some basic data cleanup by replacing NA values in the step column with zeros prior to mean calculation. 
* Group the steps by date and take the average.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data[is.na(data$steps), 1]<-c(0)
grouped <- group_by(data, date)
meanPerDay<-summarise(grouped, mean=mean(steps))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
